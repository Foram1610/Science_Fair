Project Description
* Each year in January a Science Fair is held with approximately 100 projects
* Each project has one or more users
* Judges log into the system on their iPads and see projects available to be judged
* A judge will go to a particular table (project) and review the presentation. They will then enter a score on their iPad for that project.
    * Four things are entered on this form:
        * Project code
        * Project Type
        * Score(s) (see scoring section below)
        * Typed in feedback (textarea)
* Once a project has been judged 3 times, no more judges are able to judge that project. That project is no longer shows up in the list of available projects. (Need a way to refresh this on the judges screen).
* Admins need to approve feedback / scores before they are submitted
* There are approximately 2 strands with approximately 4 categories each. For a total of 8 competitions. Each project is placed in a specific category in a specific strand. 
* Once scores are entered, a report is generated with 1st place, 2nd place, and 3rd place winners for each competition.

Judge
* Can evaluate a project
    * Score1 (Required for Euro-Science)
    * Score2 (Required for Euro-Science)
    * Score3 (Required for both Euro-Science and Indigenous Ways Strand)
    * Feedback (Required)
    * Once score is submitted, it will be added to the database with a status of “needs_approval” (Required)
* Once a project is submitted by a judge it will have status of “needs_approval”. An admin cannot change scores of the project, but an admin can set status to “approved”, “needs_approval”, or “rejected”
* Any project score that is marked as “approved” or “needs_approval” counts towards the total count of 3.
* Any project score that is marked as “rejected” is not counted towards the total count of 3 judges. 3 other judges will still need to judge this project.
* Any project score that is marked as “approved” will be counted towards the final score calculation.
* When an admin views the list of project scores, projects scores that are approved will have a green indicator, project scores still needing to be approved will have a yellow indicator, and project scores that are rejected will have a red indicator. This page will need to be kept up to date so that an admin will see new project scores coming in to approve.

Form – web-based 
Back-end – database driven
Viewable data / results – web page

Output:

* Shows winners per category (of 8 categories)
* Start with Youth – in order of 3rd, 2nd, 1st
    * Euroscience youngest
    * Indigenous youngest
* Youth, Junior, Intermediate, Senior
* CSV Export

Scores:

Scores are calculated as follows:

* If project is Indigenous Ways a single score is taken from 0 to 100
* If project is Euro-Science (Experiment, Innovation, or Study) score is taken as follows:
    * Score_1: 0 to 8 points
    * Score_2: 0 to 8 points
    * Score_3: 0 to 20 points
    * Calculation is: (Score_1 * 5 + Score_2 * 5 + Score 3) for a total of 100 max points
* Remember 3 judges will judge each project, so the average is taken between all three judges. Scores will be rounded to nearest whole number. (We should be careful here in case a project is accidentally judged 4 times. If so, the average of all 4 are taken, etc.)
* The top three winners of each of the 8 categories will be taken. If there are ties for the top three places, more winners may be shown.
* A separate page will show ALL averaged scores sorted by the 8 different categories.
